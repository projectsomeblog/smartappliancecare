    <h2>Common Fridge Problems They Fix</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fridge not cooling properly:</strong> Often caused by a faulty compressor, thermostat, or refrigerant leak.</li>
      <li><strong>Freezer icing or over-freezing:</strong> Usually linked to defrost system failures or airflow issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Water leaking inside or underneath the fridge:</strong> Typically due to a clogged defrost drain or cracked water line.</li>
      <li><strong>Unusual noises:</strong> Clicking, buzzing, or rattling sounds can indicate fan, motor, or compressor problems.</li>
      <li><strong>Damaged door seals (gaskets):</strong> Worn seals allow cold air to escape, forcing your fridge to work harder.</li>
      <li><strong>Electrical or control panel faults:</strong> Malfunctioning digital displays, sensors, or circuit boards.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Their expertise spans <strong>major brands like Samsung, LG, Bosch, Whirlpool, Hisense, Defy</strong> and more, ensuring your appliance is in capable hands.</p>

    <h2>Professional, Transparent, and Reliable Service</h2>
    <p>Smart Appliance Care is built on three key values: honesty, skill, and customer satisfaction. Each repair begins with a thorough inspection to identify the root cause of the problem. Once the issue is clear, you receive an upfront quote covering labour and parts - so you can decide whether it's better to repair or replace your fridge.</p>

They not only fix your fridge but also offer advice on preventing future breakdowns. Their friendly, professional approach and commitment to quality service have earned them a reputation as one of South Africa's most dependable appliance repair companies.</p>

    <h2>When to Call the Professionals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The fridge or freezer isn't cooling as it should.</li>
      <li>You notice water puddles or condensation inside.</li>
      <li>There's excessive frost or ice build-up.</li>
      <li>The motor runs constantly or makes loud noises.</li>
      <li>The temperature display is malfunctioning.</li>
      <li>Your electricity bill suddenly spikes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Leaving these problems unchecked can lead to serious damage, such as compressor failure - one of the costliest fridge repairs. A quick call to Smart Appliance Care can prevent that outcome.</p>

    <h2>Simple Maintenance Tips to Keep Your Fridge Running Longer</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Clean condenser coils every six months to remove dust and debris.</li>
      <li>Inspect and clean door seals regularly to maintain an airtight fit.</li>
      <li>Avoid overloading your fridge; allow proper airflow inside.</li>
      <li>Defrost the freezer when ice builds up more than 5 mm thick.</li>
      <li>Keep the appliance level so the doors seal properly.</li>
      <li>Position your fridge away from direct sunlight or heat sources.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These simple steps can help prevent overheating, poor cooling performance, and unnecessary energy consumption.</p>

    <h2>Repair or Replace? Making the Smart Choice</h2>
    <p>While Smart Appliance Care can fix most refrigerator issues, sometimes replacement makes more sense. If your fridge is over 10 years old, uses outdated technology, or has a major sealed-system problem, a new energy-efficient model might be a wiser investment.</p>

    <p>Before spending thousands on a replacement, get a professional assessment. Smart Appliance Care's technicians provide honest advice based on the cost of repair, the age of your fridge, and part availability - helping you make a cost-effective decision.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Smart Appliance Care?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Specialised fridge repair expertise.</li>
      <li>Same-day service for urgent issues.</li>
      <li>Transparent pricing and no hidden costs.</li>
